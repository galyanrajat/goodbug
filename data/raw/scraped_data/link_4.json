About a decade ago, researchers noted that the loss of interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs) might be linked to the cellular pathophysiology underlying gastroparesis. More recently, researchers have begun examining the role of the immune system and its dysregulation in gastroparesis. Observations in animal models suggested that immune cells play a critical role in maintaining and protecting enteric neuronal andICCfunction, which can affect motility in the gastrointestinal tract.",
